# ![Logo](/docs/logo_64.png) Scalingo Review App Manager

Small and lightweight utility that automatically stop & restart your review apps on Scalingo each working day.

## Presentation

### Who

This library may interest you if you : 
- host your infrastructure on [Scalingo platform](https://scalingo.com)
- use the mechanism of [Review Apps (a.k.a. RA)](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/app/review-apps)
- are used to have multiple RA (at least 2) opened for more than a day   

In particular, you will be concerned if you have enabled the option to "create review app for each new Pull Request".

### Why

The firt goal of this library is to help you saving (a little bit of) money.
 
Another goal we have in mind is to reduce our consumption of useless IT resources.

> We know that Scalingo must reserved physical servers in all cases and that the economy of resource consumption is insignificant at the scale ot the planet, but we believe that "a little bit" is even better than "not at all" ðŸ˜‰.

### How

In order to use `scalingo-review-app-manager` :
1. add the library as a dependency in a Scalingo Node.js project
2. in your application code, declare a new `ReviewAppManager`
3. add an instruction to start the `EcoMode`
4. push & deploy your project on Scalingo

### What

You can find a real production example [here](https://github.com/1024pix/pix-bot). 

Pix Bot is a little web application hosted on Scalingo that help us â€“ [Pix](https://github.com/1024pix/) â€“ to automate internal processes and manage critical operations.

In particular, Pix Bot is responsible to manage all of our Review Apps (about 60 S-sized opened by day).

Thanks to `scalingo-review-app-manager`, **we estimate that we save between 3500$ and 5000$ a year**. 

## Basic Usage

**1/** Install the dependency.

```javascript
npm install scalingo-review-app-manager
```

**2/** Declare a new `ReviewAppManager` and run the CRON-based "Eco Mode".

```javascript
const ReviewAppManager = require('../index').ReviewAppManager;

const reviewAppManager = new ReviewAppManager('tk-us-DkjGg...', 'https://api.osc-fr1.scalingo.com');

reviewAppManager.startEcoMode().then(() => console.log('Eco Mode enabled.'));
```

## Advanced usage

### Custom stop & restart times

By default review apps will be shut down every week day at 7pm and will be restarted the day after (if it is a week day) at 8am.

You can customize the stop and restart times by passing `stopCronTime` and/or `restartCronTime` parameters (RegExp strings) to the ReviewAppManager constructor.

```javascript
const options = {
  stopCronTime: '0 0 22 * * 1-5',
  restartCronTime: '0 0 6 * * 1-5'
};
(new ReviewAppManager(scalingoToken, scalingoApiUrl, options)).startEcoMode();
```

### Ignoring some review apps

By default, all the review apps will be stopped and restarted according to stop & restart times.

You can ignore some review apps by passing `ignoredReviewApps` parameter (array of strings) to the ReviewAppManager constructor.

```javascript
const options = {
  ignoredReviewApps: ['my-app-review-pr1', 'my-app-review-pr3']
};
(new ReviewAppManager(scalingoToken, scalingoApiUrl, options)).startEcoMode();
```

### Scalingo pending operations limit management

The Scalingo API limits the numbers of applications scaling in the same time. 

To deal with this limit, a mechanism of polling by application scaling is set up.

By default, the scaling status of each application is checked every 1000ms with a maximum of 10 attempts. 
These values can be parameterized in the options object of the `ReviewAppManager` constructor : `pollTimeInterval` (number, in ms) and `pollMaxAttempts` (number).

```javascript
const options = {
  pollTimeInterval: 1000,
  pollMaxAttempts: 10
};
(new ReviewAppManager(scalingoToken, scalingoApiUrl, options)).startEcoMode();
```

### Specifying cron jobs time zone

By default, the cron jobs are based on UTC server's local time zone.

You can set up a specific time zone with the `timeZone` option, cf. [the list of available time zones](https://github.com/eggert/tz/blob/c7cc14a846e1dcaa2800f3f0070a12fd514f608c/zone.tab).

```javascript
const options = {
  timeZone: 'Europe/Paris',
};
(new ReviewAppManager(scalingoToken, scalingoApiUrl, options)).startEcoMode();
```
